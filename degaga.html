    <h1>Rev: Dagaga's background</h1>
    <h2>Short Biography</h2>

<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;"> I am Rev. Dagaga Gemachu Regassa, born in 1988 in Ibantu, a rural village in East Wallaga region of Oromia, Ethiopia. Growing up in a farming family, I learned the values of hard work and the importance of community, even as we endured the challenges posed by the oppressive Derg regime, a socialist military junta that ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987. This period was marked by severe persecution of Christians; churches were destroyed, and many believers were imprisoned or killed. The resilience and faith of my Christian parents during these trials shaped my own spiritual journey profoundly.</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">As a member of the Ethiopian Evangelical Church of Mekane Yesus, I embraced strong Christian values and the lesson of discipleship, guiding my deepening faith. I eventually became a youth leader in our church, marking the beginning of my dedication to God’s service.
Supported by European missionaries, I moved to Addis Ababa for Bible studies at the certificate level, which broadened my horizons and deepened my faith. Encouraged to further my theological education, I moved to Nairobi in 2011, joining the Oromo Christian Fellowship Nairobi (OCFN). There, my leadership potential was recognized and nurtured. With fellowship support, I earned an Associate Degree from the International College of Bible Theology in 2014 and began serving as an evangelist with OCFN, focusing on the Oromo people for three years.</p><p>
<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;" >In October 2016, amid political turmoil, I felt a divine call to return to Ethiopia. This decision led me to lead the Biftu Bole Congregation of the Ethiopian Evangelical Church of Mekane Yesus as a leader and missionary department coordinator. From 2017 to October 2023, I played a crucial role in establishing over 100 churches, significantly advancing our church's mission across Ethiopia.
In 2019, I obtained a Master of World Mission from Leadstar Theological College, enhancing my missionary and leadership skills. That year, I also married Bruktawit Samuel, a dedicated health officer who left her job to join our missionary life, embracing significant sacrifices for our calling. We are blessed with a son, and together, we continue our service, guided by faith and commitment to spreading God’s word.
My life's journey underscores the power of faith and the strength from a life dedicated to service and the greater good.<p> </div>
