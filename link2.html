    <h1>OCFN Sends Missionaries to the Western World</h1>
    <p>Our congregation members are predominantly refugees. Most are recognized by the United Nations Humanitarian Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). This means they go through intensive interviews to determine if they really were under political persecution in their home country and would be in danger if they returned to Ethiopia. Based on that, the office of UNHCR facilitates sending them on third-country resettlement to many developed countries showing a willingness to take them. These countries include the U.S., Canada, European countries, and Australia. Our records show that our congregation members who resettled in the diaspora, gathered the scattered Oromo Christians and started churches where there is no Oromo church, or serve as ministers or church leaders if the church is already started.

        We thank the Lord for this because they continued spreading the Gospel and have become pioneers for the Great Commission in the diaspora community.</p>
