    <h2>A Calling to the Oromo Christian Fellowship in Nairobi</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
    Let’s outline the history and mission of the Oromo Christian Fellowship Church in Nairobi (OCFN), which has significantly impacted its community for 23 years. Originating from humble beginnings, OCFN was founded by individuals escaping adversity, serving as a beacon of hope and faith. Despite numerous challenges, including persecution, the church's commitment has flourished.</LongCaption>

<p style=" font-size: 1.5rem;">Currently, OCFN holds services in the Evangelical Lutheran church building, as it lacks a dedicated worship space, highlighting its grassroots nature and dependence on Nairobi’s broader Christian community.

    <h2>Holistic Ministry</h2>
<p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
OCFN's commitment encompasses spiritual and essential social services, addressing the Borana pastoral community's challenges. This region frequently experiences severe droughts that affect food, water, and livestock, crucial to the community's livelihood. In response, OCFN provides vital humanitarian aid with food and water supplies to alleviate drought impacts. This holistic approach meets both spiritual and practical needs, emphasizing the church's dedication to supporting the Borana through environmental and economic hardships, aligning with its mission to promote resilience and hope.<p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
        OCFN faced various challenges, notably lack of ordained pastor to effectively oversee, and coordinate its expanding church activities. This had particularly impacted the ministry's ability to administer holy sacraments and provide consistent Bible teaching, which are central to its operations.</p>
         <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;">
        To resolve this, OCFN reached out to the North American Lutheran Church (NALC) to request support in appointing a pastor. As a result, NALC, through the sending agency ALWM, appointed me as a global worker to Nairobi, Kenya. Embracing the call wholeheartedly, I moved to Nairobi, undertaking the role to guide and grow the fellowship.</p>
