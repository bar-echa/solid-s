    <h1>OCFN Serves Oromo-Speaking Christians in Urban Nairobi</h1>
    <p>The church is led by five church leaders â€“ three elected members from the congregation, a mission coordinator, and the pastor of the church. We keep active Bible studies, prayers, trainings and seminars for leaders to keep ourselves in the mirror of Christ, be graced with the shoulder to handle this displaced, destitute, distressed and mostly young generation in our congregation. <br>
        n addition to focusing on liturgy and sacraments, the church facilitates worship and office space for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oromo_language">Oromo-speaking</a> Christians fleeing from the Ethiopian regime. We also encourage, follow up and bring back backsliders, evangelize amongst those who do not know the Gospel, support and counsel depressed and disturbed congregation members, teach the Word, and try to rehabilitate those trapped in destructive and dangerous habits as well as provide prayers and counseling to those who are psychologically disturbed.

        The church also gives basic assistance to the destitute and selects gifted youth, connecting them to Bible colleges. We also work on improving their English language capacity by using volunteers from within the community.
        <br>
        In a few years the church grew bigger, and more skilled people and anointed ministers arrived in Nairobi as refugees. God gave us the vision not only to focus on the church members we are serving, but also to extend our evangelization amongst the wider Oromo community residing within Nairobi and the surrounding cities. The estimated population of the Oromo refugees was over 20,000 in Nairobi, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadaab">Dadaab, </a>and  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakuma">Kakuma</a> refugee camps when we started. We were puzzled to see a significant number of refugees coming from Ethiopia who did not know the Lord. The harvest was unbelievable, and we were so blessed with the outcome. Glory be to God for all the work done!
